description: "Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data."

# About {-}
*Topics in Quantum Information Science* is an introduction to the fascinating and rapidly growing field of quantum information science. It is written for those with a background in mathematics or theoretical computer science who are curious about exploring this field through mathematical and computational lenses.

These notes do not aim to cover everythingâ€”quantum information science has grown far too vast for that. Instead, they offer a selection of topics that I have found particularly interesting in my own journey of learning.

Unless stated otherwise, the results presented here are not original, and citations are provided wherever possible.
